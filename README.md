#CQB: Where soldiers rise.  

Engage in a close-quarters battle training simulation in VR. Closely based upon a real-life CQB arena, your mission is to gradually clear an entire building by eliminating enemy targets and releasing their hostages.  Each level presents a new obstacle to overcome, giving you the chance to demonstrate your full potential.  

With a variety of weapons at your disposal, you are well-equipped to begin your training. Choose an automatic weapon to arm yourself. You are provided with a rifle with multiple modifications that can be attached or detached.  

Press the start button and enter the arena. With every move you make you have the chance to prove yourself as a skilled soldier. Do you have what it takes to clear the premises and destroy your opponents?  

Complete the training as quickly as possible, while collecting a maximum number of points for marksmanship. Play according to the rules, otherwise, you will receive a penalty time. Once you have defeated all obstacles, end the game by pressing the final button.  

Donâ€™t miss out on the action. Rise to the challenge and strive to beat your best score.
